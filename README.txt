This is my first project using pure OpenGL.
In that project I have to make simple clone of "saper".
However the most important part is to use pixel and
vertex shaders for some simple special effects.

version 0.0
- something what is compillable.

version 0.1
- one fragment shader is working with one simple model with no lights

version 0.2
- added working vertex shader with scale and one axis rotation.
- changed file format to more complicated but supported by Blender 
  so now making models is preaty easy.
- fixed bugs with many textures shown by one fragment shader (basic fail).
- minor changes in almost all resources groups, especially with shaders
  so now one fragment/vertex shader can be shared by many shader programs.

version RC1
- selection of models work
- all game logic work
- checking if current OpenGL is 1.3 or higher work
- cleaning all code from trashes from developing done
