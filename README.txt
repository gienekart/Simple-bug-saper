This is my first project using pure OpenGL.
In that project I have to make simple clone of "saper".
However the most important part is to use pixel and
vertex shaders for some simple special effects.

version 0.0
- something what is compillable.

version 0.1
- one fragment shader is working with one simple model with no lights
